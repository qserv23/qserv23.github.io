Serverless computing has gained enormous popularity in recent years, promising
seamless scalability, fine-grained pricing, and simplified management. According
to the serverless paradigm, providers should take care of most operational
issues, with users only responsible for deploying applications and specifying
desired Quality of Service (QoS) levels. This fostered the development of the
so-called Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) computing paradigm, that is nowadays
offered by most popular cloud providers.

However, current implementations of
serverless struggle to fully realize this computing paradigm vision, and
serverless adoption for many applications is slowed down. For instance,
latency-sensitive applications cannot tolerate unpredictable cold start delays
of FaaS platforms; also, stateful serverless applications are currently not well
supported.

These challenges become even more difficult to solve as we consider
the adoption of serverless at the edge of the network as well as in the emerging
cloud-edge continuum, where resource constraints and their heterogeneity
represent a serious challenge for QoS guarantees.


In this workshop, we solicit high quality contributions that fit with the overarching theme of guaranteeing
QoS levels in serverless computing systems and applications.

**We invite submissions of original research papers, as well as vision papers
and experience reports.**
