The workshop aims to promote discussions on architectures, mechanisms, and algorithms to support QoS-aware deployment and execution of serverless applications. Topics of interest include (but are not limited to):

 - Performance modeling, isolation, and optimization for serverless applications
 - Resource management for serverless systems in cloud and edge environments
 - Middleware and frameworks for QoS-aware serverless
 - Serverless architectures in the cloud-edge continuum
 - Scheduling, offloading, and elasticity techniques for serverless functions
 - Reliable, fault-tolerant, and available serverless systems
 - Energy-efficient and sustainable serverless computing
 - QoS-aware serverless in Internet of Things applications
 - Artificial Intelligence solutions for QoS-aware orchestration of serverless functions
