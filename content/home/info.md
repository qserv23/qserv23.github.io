Authors are invited to submit papers electronically through [CMT](https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/QSERV2023/Track/1/Submission/Create).

Submitted manuscripts must represent original unpublished research that is not currently under review for any other conference or journal. Manuscripts are submitted in PDF format and may not exceed **six (6) pages**, including figures, tables, and references, in the standard **ACM format** for conference proceedings. All manuscripts will be reviewed and judged on correctness, originality,technical strength, rigour in analysis, quality of results, quality of presentation, and interest and relevance to the conference attendees. Your submission is subject to a determination that you are not under any sanctions by ACM. 

The workshop adopts a **double-blind** review process, where neither authors nor reviewers know each otherâ€™s identities. This means that papers must not list or otherwise identify the authors. References to previous work should be done in the third person so as to not reveal the identities of the authors. Submissions that are not anonymous may be rejected without review. 

At least one author of each accepted paper must be registered for the conference (Note: full registration, non-student, non-workshop) in order for the paper to be published in the proceedings.
